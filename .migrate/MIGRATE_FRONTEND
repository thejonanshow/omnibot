# Frontend Migration Trigger

This file triggers the automatic frontend migration when committed to a branch.

## What happens when you commit this file:

1. GitHub Actions detects this marker file
1. Runs the migration script automatically
1. Commits the refactored code to your branch
1. Comments on the PR with status

## Migration changes:

- Splits monolithic `index.html` into modular structure
- Creates `frontend/styles/` with base, themes, and components CSS
- Creates `frontend/js/` with 6 modular JavaScript files
- Adds test template in `frontend/tests/`
- Backs up original file as `index.backup.html`

## To trigger migration:

```bash
# From mobile or desktop
git add .migrate/
git commit -m "Trigger frontend migration"
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Thatâ€™s it! GitHub Actions handles the rest.
