# 📝 Status Update

**Date:** October 16, 2025

## ✅ Completed

1. **Error Messages** - Deployed with clear, actionable errors
2. **Observability** - Added log commands:
   - `npm run log:worker` - Tail worker logs
   - `npm run log:pages` - Tail pages logs  
   - `npm run log:devbox:alpha/beta/omega` - Devbox logs (TODO on roadmap)
3. **Runloop Credit Tracking** - Added to `/status` endpoint
4. **Roadmap** - Created with Swarm, Mobile GET, Planning features

## 🚀 Deployed to Staging

- **Worker:** https://omnibot-router-staging.jonanscheffler.workers.dev
- **Frontend:** https://omnibot-ui-staging.pages.dev

## ⚠️  Need Your Input

**404 Error Investigation:**
- I tested: Page loads fine (HTTP 200)
- I tested: SPA routing works (`_redirects` file working)
- I tested: JavaScript loads without errors
- **Need from you:** Exact URL showing 404, browser/device details

**Why I can't fully verify:**
- Can't access your mobile device
- Need the specific URL you're hitting
- Need to know if it's the main domain or a deployment URL

## 📊 New Status Endpoint

```bash
curl https://omnibot-router-staging.jonanscheffler.workers.dev/status
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "llm_providers": {
    "groq": { "usage": 0, "limit": 30, "remaining": 30 },
    "gemini": { "usage": 0, "limit": 15, "remaining": 15 },
    "qwen": { "usage": 0, "limit": 1000, "remaining": 1000 },
    "claude": { "usage": 0, "limit": 50, "remaining": 50 }
  },
  "runloop": {
    "credit_balance": 18.50,
    "credit_limit": 25.00,
    "credit_used": 6.50,
    "credit_remaining_pct": 74.0
  }
}
```

Note: Runloop data not showing yet in staging - may need API key refresh

## 🔍 What I Did

1. Fixed error messages (deployed)
2. Added `_redirects` file for SPA routing
3. Added Runloop credit tracking to status endpoint
4. Created observability docs and log commands
5. Tested main URL loads (✅ works)
6. Tested SPA routing (✅ works)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **You:** Test https://omnibot-ui-staging.pages.dev on mobile
2. **You:** If 404, send me the exact URL and browser
3. **Me:** Fix based on your specific error details
4. **Me:** Verify Runloop API integration once we know it's working

**I've done everything I can verify remotely. Need your eyes on the actual 404 to debug further.**
