# ðŸ”„ Self-Upgrade Feature

## Overview

Omni-Agent can now upgrade ITSELF using your voice with ZERO downtime!

## How It Works

```
You say: "Add dark mode theme"
         â†“
Worker fetches current codebase from GitHub
         â†“
Claude API analyzes code + your request
         â†“
Claude generates code changes
         â†“
Worker commits changes to GitHub
         â†“
Worker triggers new Cloudflare deployment
         â†“
New version deploys (old version still running)
         â†“
Traffic switches to new version automatically
         â†“
ZERO DOWNTIME âœ“
```

## Usage

### Method 1: Voice Command

1. Say: **"upgrade mode"**
2. System confirms: "UPGRADE MODE ACTIVE"
3. Say your change: **"add a dark mode toggle button"**
4. System modifies itself and redeploys
5. Done! Changes live in ~60 seconds

### Method 2: Button

1. Click **ðŸ”§ Upgrade** button
2. Status shows "UPGRADE" mode
3. Click **ðŸŽ¤ Speak**
4. Describe the change
5. System auto-upgrades

## Examples

**Add Features:**
- "Add a dark mode theme with toggle button"
- "Add a retry button for failed requests"
- "Add keyboard shortcuts for speak and stop"

**Change UI:**
- "Change the theme to cyberpunk colors"
- "Make the buttons larger on mobile"
- "Add animations to the status indicators"

**Improve Functionality:**
- "Add caching for frequent requests"
- "Add voice-to-voice mode without typing"
- "Add conversation export to JSON"

**Fix Issues:**
- "Fix the microphone permission error handling"
- "Improve error messages to be more helpful"
- "Add loading spinner during API calls"

## Setup

During `./setup.sh`, answer **yes** to:
```
Enable self-upgrade capability? (y/n): y
```

This will prompt for:
- GitHub Personal Access Token (with repo permissions)
- Your GitHub repo (username/repo)
- Cloudflare API Token (for deployments)

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Frontend (`frontend/index.html`)**
   - Upgrade Mode toggle
   - Voice input for changes
   - Status display

2. **Worker (`cloudflare-worker/src/index.js`)**
   - `/upgrade` endpoint
   - GitHub API integration
   - Cloudflare deployment API

3. **Upgrade Module (`cloudflare-worker/src/upgrade.js`)**
   - Fetches current code
   - Calls Claude with context
   - Parses changes
   - Commits to GitHub
   - Triggers deployment

### Zero Downtime

Cloudflare Workers use versioned deployments:
1. New version deployed alongside old
2. Traffic gradually shifts
3. Old version removed after verification
4. No dropped requests!

## Security

- **HMAC Auth**: All upgrade requests require signature
- **Challenge-Response**: Prevents replay attacks
- **GitHub Token**: Stored as Cloudflare secret
- **Rate Limiting**: Max 5 upgrades per hour

## Limitations

- Can't change Cloudflare KV structure (would lose data)
- Can't modify secrets (must use Wrangler CLI)
- Complex changes may need multiple iterations
- ~60 second deployment time

## Troubleshooting

### "GitHub token invalid"
```bash
cd /Users/jonan/src/claudebox/omni-agent/cloudflare-worker
echo "YOUR_NEW_TOKEN" | npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN
```

### "Deployment failed"
Check Cloudflare dashboard:
https://dash.cloudflare.com/

### "Changes not applied"
Check GitHub repo - commit should appear:
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/commits

### "Can't enable upgrade mode"
Make sure setup completed with GitHub configuration:
```bash
./setup.sh
# Answer 'y' to self-upgrade capability
```

## Advanced Usage

### Manual Upgrade (API)

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/upgrade \
  -H "X-Challenge: $CHALLENGE" \
  -H "X-Timestamp: $TIMESTAMP" \
  -H "X-Signature: $SIGNATURE" \
  -d '{
    "instruction": "Add feature X"
  }'
```

### Programmatic Upgrade

```javascript
const response = await sendUpgrade("Add dark mode");
console.log(response.changes); // Files modified
console.log(response.deployment_triggered); // true
```

## Cost

- GitHub API: FREE
- Cloudflare Deployments: FREE (unlimited)
- Claude API calls: ~$0.01 per upgrade
- **Total: ~$0.01 per upgrade**

## Future Enhancements

Could add:
- Preview changes before applying
- Rollback to previous version
- A/B testing new features
- Automatic testing before deploy
- Multi-file change tracking
- Approval workflow

## Example Session

```
YOU: "upgrade mode"
SYSTEM: "UPGRADE MODE ACTIVE"

YOU: "Add a button to export conversation history as JSON"
SYSTEM: "UPGRADE IN PROGRESS..."
SYSTEM: "âœ“ Changes applied:"
SYSTEM: "  - frontend/index.html: Added export button and JSON download function"
SYSTEM: "âœ“ Deployment triggered. Changes live in ~60s."

[60 seconds later]

SYSTEM: "Normal mode resumed"
```

## Questions?

The system can help itself! Just ask:
- "How do I use the upgrade feature?"
- "What files can be modified?"
- "Show me upgrade examples"

**Ready to try it?**

1. Run: `./deploy.sh`
2. Say: **"upgrade mode"**
3. Say: **"add X feature"**
4. Watch it upgrade itself! ðŸ¤¯
