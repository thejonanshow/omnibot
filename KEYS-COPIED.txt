✅ API KEYS COPIED FROM LISTLIFT-AI
====================================

## What Was Copied

From `/Users/jonan/src/claudebox/listlift-ai/.env` → `/Users/jonan/src/claudebox/omni-agent/.env`:

✓ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (Claude)
✓ GROQ_API_KEY (Llama - FREE!)
✓ GEMINI_API_KEY (Google - FREE!)
✓ RUNLOOP_API_KEY (for voice services)

## Generated

✓ SHARED_SECRET (HMAC authentication key)

## Still Need

⚠️ OPENAI_API_KEY (optional - for GPT models)
⚠️ GITHUB_TOKEN (optional - for self-upgrade)
⚠️ GITHUB_REPO (optional - for self-upgrade)
⚠️ CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID (auto-detected during deploy)
⚠️ CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN (optional - for self-upgrade)

## Status

**READY TO DEPLOY!**

You have the 3 most important API keys:
1. Claude (Anthropic)
2. Groq (FREE Llama)
3. Gemini (FREE Google)

This is enough to run the entire system with:
- Multi-provider LLM rotation
- Voice input/output (browser APIs)
- Zero cost on free tiers!

## Next Step

```bash
cd /Users/jonan/src/claudebox/omni-agent
./deploy.sh
```

The deploy script will:
1. Detect these API keys ✓
2. Skip prompting for them
3. Login to Cloudflare
4. Deploy worker + frontend
5. Return production URLs

Takes ~3 minutes since keys are already configured!

## Optional: Self-Upgrade

If you want self-upgrade capability, run:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

And answer:
- Enable self-upgrade? **y**
- GitHub token? **[paste token]**
- GitHub repo? **username/omni-agent**

But you can deploy NOW without this and add it later!

## Cost Estimate

With these keys configured:
- Groq: FREE (30 req/day)
- Gemini: FREE (15 req/min)
- Claude: ~$2/month (overages only)

**Total: ~$2/month for 100 daily requests**

## Security

✓ .env file in .gitignore (not committed to git)
✓ Keys will be stored as Cloudflare secrets (encrypted)
✓ HMAC shared secret generated (secure)

Your keys are safe!
